Given there is an ondemand general medical requested video consult in DNK for that member
Given there is a topdanmark_rte group with general medical, expert medical opinion enabled
And there is a registered member from DNK for this group
And inbox is disabled for this member
And I am using the member_topdanmark site

And the member simply logs in only
